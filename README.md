Sorted-Linked-List
==================

Linked list that sorts lexicographically

Purpose: Use a reference based linked-list to store strings entered by a user via the command prompt

Included Files:
- .java file to view code and comments
- .class files to run code
- Test cases .docx to show example test cases

Features:
- Based on the previous project, "Sorted ArrayList"
- Added separate WordNode object that contains a word (string entered by user) and a reference pointer (points to the next node in the linked list)
- Simple instructions: 'showlist', 'insert', 'delete', 'deleteall', and 'end'
- Allows multiple word inserts (i.e. insert dog cat mouse)
- Sorts in alphabetical order automatically as you add new words to the list

All Code created by me for CS320 - Data Structures: Program Assignment 3
